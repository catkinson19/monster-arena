# monster-arena
A game using jQuery that was overly ambitious given my timeline... It works but isn't feature complete.

## Working Locally:
Looks like Chrome isn't happy looking for my monstere list locally, so start it using this command:
`open -a Google\ Chrome --args --allow-file-access-from-files`
