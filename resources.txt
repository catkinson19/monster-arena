Need to make:

Omnivore Air Solitary


//Psuedo

User is prompted to select a creature by answering 3 questions:

What is your consumption classification:
Omnivore:
Herbavore:
Carnivore:

What environment do you live in?
Ocean:
Land:
Sky:

Are you your social instincts?
Solitary:
Pack:

The answers to those questions set a variable array bio=[con, env, soc]

I need to create a a Json library of monsters (tonight)


mName{
mHealth: int
mAttack: int
mSpeed: int
mClass: [con, env, soc]
mThreat: int
nImage: src
}

Based on the answers to the question I assign a monster to a variable myMonster.
The document flows through a method that builds out an object based on the Json.
As the document is pulled, it's taken out of play.

The monster is rendered on the left side of the screen. The picture is facing left.

This is where that actual game starts

The user then gets fed one of 10 stories. These stories inject the monsters name into the narrative.
They will at some point have to account for plural cases? Maybe store them as Json objects?
The stories have 3 possible resolutions.

story{
    sContent: string
    resolution:{
        res1{
            rContent: string
            rThreat: low
        }
        res2{
            rContent: string
            rThreat: middle
        }
        res3{
            rContent: string
            rThreat: high
        }
    }
}

The resolutions are given a rThreat value of 1-10.
The higher the number, the more likely the monster's mThreat level will be high as well.

The player then enters a battle.
